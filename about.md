This blog is where I'm going to put stuff I've worked out that I don't want to forget. Hopefully it will be useful to others - who knows!

## About me

My name is Mark Tully and I'm a games and server coder. I've been in the games industry since 2002, working on AAA console for most of that, but recently I've moved to mobile. I've worked at Free Radical Design, Crytek UK, Dambuster and I now code servers for Avakin Life at [Lockwood Publishing](http://lockwoodpublishing.com). It goes without saying that this blog contains my words and not those of my employer - right?

I've worked in most areas of game code over my career: engine, tools, game and server code; as well as leading on several projects. Most of my time I've been coding in C or C++, but I've also done non-trivial projects in other languages, like 68k assembler, PHP, Perl, Python, Go, Java, Javascript, Typescript and C#. Currently, I mostly code servers in Java, Typescript and Go.

I live in leafy Nottingham in the UK.

## Non work projects

I started coding using AMOS Basic back on my Amiga in the 90s, and I enjoyed it so much that when I knew how, I made a similar project for the Mac called [TNT Basic](http://www.tntbasic.com). Sadly, it's something that I no longer have the time to maintain.

Several years ago I also made an iPhone game called [Flock Control](http://www.flockcontrol.co.uk), which was a fun experience, but it didn't exactly set the App Store alight. I took it down a few years ago, so if you have an urge to herd sheep using your iPhone, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere.

I also dabble in home electronics occasionally and run our house's heating from a Raspberry Pi. I'll probably do some write ups on this at some point too.

Thanks for visiting!
